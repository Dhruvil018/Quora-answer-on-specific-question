            "text": "The details depend on the kind of fruit used and how you\u2019ll be using the puree.\n\nIt typically involves cooking, forcing it through a food mill or sieve, adding sugar and/or lemon juice, and maybe spices to taste.\n\nIf you\u2019re doing a berry puree, you may heat them only enough so that the juice begins to release\u2026.. if you\u2019re using quince, you\u2019re going to have to simmer them 40\u201390 minutes, depending on how small you cut them and the temp.\n\nDespite the fact that raw quince is as hard to cut as a rock and not at all tasty, cooked quince is fabulous and makes a spectacular puree to offset both meats and deserts - just adjust your seasonings appropriately.",
